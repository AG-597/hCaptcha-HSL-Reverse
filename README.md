# hCaptcha-HSL-Reverse
This reverses the HSL fingerprint generated by hCaptcha also known as the "n" value

This allows you to create a custom fingerprint using an hcaptcha req token 

This makes it a lot easier when solving captchas due to this dynamicly generating the hsl fingerprint

# More Info

The current HSL verison this is reversed on is `9558cb7d3137b7fb08f830d9a7e24f0114211b7450d68c13703df8c17692aed3`

I have added more debugging int he python script if anyone wnats to see more on how it functions

You can find the orgiinal hsl.js script along with the hsl.py script in this repo

# How to use 

Open `hsl.py` and scroll to the bottom where you see `print(hsl("token"))` replace `token` with your actual hsl token

after doing this it will print out the hsl fingerprint ready for usage

# Other stuff
