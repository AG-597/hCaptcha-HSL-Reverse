# hCaptcha-HSL-Reverse
This reverses the HSL fingerprint generated by hCaptcha also known as the "n" value

This allows you to create a custom fingerprint using an hcaptcha req token 

This makes it a lot easier when solving captchas due to this dynamicly generating the hsl fingerprint

# More Info

The current HSL verison this is reversed on is `0da7bbe`

You can find the orgiinal hsl.js script along with the hsl.py script in this repo

# How to use 

Open `hsl.py` and scroll to the bottom where you see `print(hsl("token"))` replace `token` with your actual hsl token

after doing this it will print out the hsl fingerprint ready for usage

# Other stuff
Please star

This took about 30 minutes to do, so please create an issue if there are any problems 

I'll continue to maintain this if I get 10 stars
